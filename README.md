# Data Science Small Test
My solution for a test that I've received for a Data Scientist position. The code was made in iPython/Jupyter Notebook, [you can access it here](https://israelmendez232.github.io/data-science-small-test.html).

**Instructions**<br />
```
1. Choose the a language of interest (R / Python / Matlab)
2. Read the dataset, it is tab separated, contains header and the first column is the index.
3. The results can be presented in any format. We suggest a iPython notebook for python users and RMarkdown for R users.
4. Please comment the main steps of your code.
5. Imagine that the results will be presented for a non-technical audience so try to emphasize the results of your work.
```

## Solution
The present three others models to show the better solution for the problem.
